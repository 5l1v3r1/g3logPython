[pyg3log](https://github.com/GreyDireWolf/pyg3log.git) is another wrapper for g3log. It's advantage is being more lightweight than g3logPython. It does not (yet in 02/2020) implement the call() method through g3log sink handles, nor does it include a data store as we do to extend the lifetime of python strings.  Note that this may not be required if the default sink parameters suit your application.
